HELP JOHN WICK FIND HIS DOG BEFORE THE GONG !!!

As you all know, John Wick's dog means everything to our beloved hero, upon all that exists and breaths on this planet. Bromance cannot be explained, man !

Since once not the norm, bad guys had kidnapped John Wick's dog and took the pet in Paris, hidding it in a shady casino located "Place de Clichy", in order to move our hero far away from US !

That's terrible news, feel bad for them right now.

As John Wick never came in Paris before, here is your mission :
you will have to give him a hand to retreive his dog, and bring it back to his owner.

To succeed, you must face up to a Bonto game.
But notice that you have to figure it out before a final countdown !

Else, if you fail, John Wick could be very pissed of, and remove you from earth.

So...good luck !!!
